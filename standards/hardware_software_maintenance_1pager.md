# Computer Hardware & Software Maintenance (110101) — One‑Pager

## Big Goals

- Identify/upgrade components; perform drivers/firmware updates and backups.
- Apply methodical troubleshooting; compare client OS management tools.
- Set up and document a basic SOHO network.


## Evidence to Publish (Portfolio)

- Component ID gallery + build sheets.
- Maintenance log (drivers/firmware/backups) with before/after notes.
- Two troubleshooting write‑ups (one success, one dead‑end with root‑cause analysis).
- SOHO network plan and checklist.


## First 12‑Week Milestones

1) Safety + tools + component ID.  
2) Drivers/firmware + backups.  
3) Troubleshooting labs + reflections.  
4) SOHO network setup doc.


## Safety & Scope Guardrails

- Follow ESD and lab safety; instructor sign‑off before physical work.
- Backup first; never work on a device with real user data.
