# Help Desk Operations (110102) — One‑Pager

## Big Goals

- Operate a professional help desk: roles, tools, SLAs, and customer communication.
- Build end‑user documentation and training; analyze trends and report metrics.
- Practice conflict resolution and a methodical problem‑solving process.


## Evidence to Publish (Portfolio)

- 3 KB articles; ticket transcript with high‑quality comms.
- SLA/metrics snapshot (CSV + chart) and a short trends note.
- A conflict‑resolution reflection using a real or mock scenario.


## First 12‑Week Milestones

1) osTicket roles/departments; ticket etiquette.  
2) KB writing sprints; mock ticket day.  
3) Metrics export + chart; trends memo.  
4) “Service Handbook” page (request → response → change).


## Safety & Scope Guardrails

- Start with CS‑only intake; escalate scope as SLAs stabilize.
- Keep tickets de‑identified; no student grades/discipline in tickets.


    _Programming hours accumulate here via weekly portfolio sprints and tagged artifacts._
