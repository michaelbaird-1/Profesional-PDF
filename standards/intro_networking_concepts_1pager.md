# Introduction to Networking Concepts (non‑vendor) (110901) — One‑Pager

## Big Goals

- Plan and implement a small wired/wireless lab; explain OSI/TCP‑IP models.
- Do addressing/subnetting; list common TCP/UDP ports and their uses.
- Produce diagrams, documentation, and basic performance/security checks.


## Evidence to Publish (Portfolio)

- Subnetting worksheet + addressing plan.
- Common ports table (≥20 entries) and a short use‑case per port.
- OSI/TCP‑IP one‑pager mapping tools to layers.
- Labeled lab diagram for OpenEMR/CMMS staging + port map.


## First 12‑Week Milestones

1) Addressing/subnetting practice; ports table draft.  
2) OSI/TCP‑IP explainer; review.  
3) Lab diagram + port map.  
4) Performance checklist + security hardening notes.


## Safety & Scope Guardrails

- Keep staging networks isolated; instructor reviews firewall rules before any test.
- No external exposure for OpenEMR/CMMS; demo datasets only.
