# Professional Branding & Theming Guidelines

Your portfolio is graded for **professionalism**. You can customize theme/colors, but follow these rules:

## Content
- Use your **real name** and a short professional bio.
- No slang, memes, or personal photos unrelated to coursework.
- Every page ends with an **Alignment** tag.

## Visuals
- Choose **one** primary color and **one** accent color.
- Use a readable body font. Keep body text between **16–20 px**.
- Maintain **sufficient contrast** for accessibility (WCAG AA).
- Provide **alt text** for images and diagrams.

## Navigation
- Keep the navbar intact. You may add links, but do not remove core sections.

## Structure
- Each artifact page includes: purpose, steps/tools, result, reflection.
- Diagrams must be labeled; code blocks must have comments.

## Privacy & Safety
- No real credentials or secrets in your repo.
- Use **demo/de-identified** data only.

## Naming
- Use lowercase-dashed filenames (e.g., `driver-update-log.md`).

**Minimum Expectations**
- Home page with a short intro and links to sections.
- At least **8** portfolio artifacts across sections by midterm.
- Consistent color scheme and headings (H1–H3).

**Exceeds Expectations**
- Custom favicon/site logo, well-written microcopy, diagram redraws, code with tests, and a “changelog” page.
