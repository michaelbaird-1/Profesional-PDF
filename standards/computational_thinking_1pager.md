# Computational Thinking (110251) — One‑Pager

## Big Goals

- Think like a computer: logic, flow, and modular problem solving.
- Write small, well‑styled programs; practice arrays/strings/Booleans; intro to OOP.
- Translate flowcharts/pseudocode into tested code; analyze binary representation.


## Evidence to Publish (Portfolio)

- Flowchart + pseudocode → working script with unit tests.
- Style checklist + short reflection on improvements.
- Mini OOP utility (e.g., osTicket CSV exporter).
- Binary worksheet and explanation.


## First 12‑Week Milestones

1) Flowcharting & style; first script.  
2) Data structures exercises; unit tests.  
3) OOP mini‑utility; code review.  
4) Refactor + documentation and posting to portfolio.


## Safety & Scope Guardrails

- No secrets in repos; use environment variables.
- Use demo data only; no PHI/PII.
